# Loan-default-Prediction
This notebook presents a machine learning approach to predicting loan defaults based on borrower data. The project involves working with a dataset that includes various features such as income levels, loan amounts, credit history, and other relevant financial attributes. The main objective is to build a model that can effectively identify whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not, which can support financial institutions in making better-informed lending decisions.

The process starts with data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the dataset is suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical data into numerical form, and selecting the most important features for prediction. After preparing the data, a brief exploratory analysis is conducted to understand the distribution of variables and highlight any significant relationships or patterns.

Following the analysis, different machine learning algorithms are implemented to train classification models. Logistic Regression and Random Forest are among the models tested. Their performance is evaluated using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports to determine which model provides the most reliable results.

The final outcome of the project is a model that can flag high-risk loan applications based on the input data. This kind of predictive system can be a valuable addition to the risk management process in the finance sector, helping to reduce the chances of approving loans that are unlikely to be repaid.
